## Tasks completed

* Added a Tensorflow directory to start working on the object detection with Tensorflow
	* Following [this](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi#step-1-train-quantized-ssd-mobilenet-model-and-export-frozen-tensorflow-lite-graph) tutorial and [this](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10#1-install-anaconda-cuda-and-cudnn) tutorial.
* Not much else, bad focus today

## Time
2 hours

## Next Task

Will be working on setting up the Tensorflow environment on my PC to train a model with the caltech birds dataset. Will try and do it in Windows to follow the tutorial better, and then push the results to the repo and run it on the Pi to test it.
