# BirdCam

Bird detector and classifier implemented using a Raspberry Pi and Tensorflow Lite.

## Things to think about

The camera will be set up to observe the bird feeder. What should be done to prevent false positives when the sway of the bird feeder indicates change?

Squirrels like to mess with the bird feeder alot also. Should Tensorflow train on squirrels as well?
