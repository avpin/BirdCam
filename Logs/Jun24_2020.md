## Tasks completed

* Motion Detection operable.
	* Still need to work on setting the parameters for it to work well with the birdfeeder outside. Need to find a sweetspot that minimizes false positives from sway of birdfeeder and maximizes chance of detecting birds. 
	* Possibly implement some sort of timer, so if there is something detected for more than 'x' amount of seconds, take a picture. This can help to ignore the birdfeeder sway or glare that is detected.
* Added glare edge case to README.md
* Added a Snippet directory.
* Added opencv_camera.py to test out using the camera with OpenCV and the imshow function.

## Time

About 3 hours

## Next task

Find the best parameters for the motion detector. Test it on a birdfeeder outside.
