## Tasks completed

* Had to follow a tutorial to get the correct libraries set up on the pi. OpenCV took some more work to install than normal.
* Started the motion_detector.py script to do the motion detection. Have a solid amount of it written out. Seems to be running, but for some reason the video feeds aren't continuous and it is just showing me images in the windows for the camera feed. For now I am posting the code to stack overflow and asking for help.
* Added a few more edge cases in the README.md
