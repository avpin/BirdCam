## Work done

* Researched more on how to use Tensorflow. Did a few examples setting up tflite models for inference.
* Created inference.py to try and implement the Birds_v1 dataset to be used for classification of birds. Still have a lot to do and research.

# Time

2 and 1/2 ish

# Next task

Want to continue to try and implement the inference script. Need to start by manipulating my future input data into the program, so creating some script that does this.
